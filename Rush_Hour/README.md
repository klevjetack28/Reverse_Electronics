# Rush Hour Console Reverse Engineering

This is my first documented project on my process of reverse engineering a retro game console. I 
document my entire process from tracing the PCB to wiring it to a logic analyzer, finally trying to 
add my own components ( sort of this is a draft idk what the end goal is )

## Playing the Game

## Hardware

## Circuit Schematics

## Logic Analyzer

## Ect

## Difficulties
